<li>David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known as David Bowie, was an English singer, songwriter and actor. Regarded as among the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Bowie received particular acclaim for his work in the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft have had a great impact on popular music.</li>
<li>Bowie studied art, music and design before embarking on a music career in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with local bands and a self-titled solo album (1967) before achieving his first top-five entry on the UK singles chart with &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969). After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The single &quot;Starman&quot; and its album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972) won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie&#39;s style shifted towards a sound he characterised as &quot;plastic soul&quot;, initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering his first major US crossover success with the number-one single &quot;Fame&quot; and the album Young Americans (1975). In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the Berlin Trilogy. &quot;Heroes&quot; (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top-five and received critical praise.<h1 id="timeline-of-his-life">Timeline of his life</h1>
